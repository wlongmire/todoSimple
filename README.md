# moreDOM-and-Events

## Instructions
1. As we get further along in the curriculum, projects will become more and more open ended to accommodate your own ideas and ways of doing things. By now, you will have seen in programming there are often many ways of getting to a solution, and it’s only fair to allow you that space to explore on your own. With that said...keep up the great effort!
2. Fork and clone this repo: [week3.day1.moreDOM-and-Events](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week3.day1.moreDOM-and-Events)
3. Do NOT alter the HTML or CSS and do not use an outside library.
4. Using what you know about the DOM and JavaScript, modify the website so the user can click and drag each “article” tag around the screen individually. When the user releases the mouse, the “article” being dragging should remain where it is.
5. There are many approaches to this task! Try to get one article working before tackling the rest.

## Extra Credit
- When the user presses the ‘spacebar’ the articles should reset to their starting positions
- Have articles “collide” with each other, and stop moving. They should not be able to pass in front of or behind one another.
